# KMeans Classification Project - Iris Dataset

Welcome to the KMeans Classification Project with the Iris dataset! This project focuses on applying the KMeans clustering algorithm for classification on the well-known Iris dataset. By leveraging the power of KMeans, we aim to discover meaningful patterns and groupings within the dataset.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, containing information about three different species of iris flowers. In this project, we employ the KMeans algorithm to classify the iris flowers into distinct clusters based on their features.

## Key Features

- **KMeans Classification:** Implement the KMeans algorithm to categorize iris flowers into clusters.

- **Data Exploration:** Explore the Iris dataset, understanding its structure and key characteristics.

- **Visualization:** Visualize the clustered data to gain insights into the inherent patterns.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
